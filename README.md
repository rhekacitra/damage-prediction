# Wildfire Damage Prediction

A machine learning solution that predicts potential damage to infrastructure, equipment, or properties based on various factors.

Created by: Rheka Narwastu & Katrina Suherman

## Overview

The Damage Prediction system uses advanced machine learning algorithms to analyze data and predict potential damage before it occurs. This proactive approach helps in maintenance planning, risk assessment, and cost reduction through preventative measures.

## Features

- **Predictive Analytics**: Forecasts potential damage based on historical data
- **Risk Assessment**: Quantifies the probability and severity of potential damage
- **Visualization Tools**: Presents predictions in an intuitive, actionable format
- **Customizable Models**: Adaptable to different types of infrastructure and equipment
- **Data Integration**: Compatible with various data sources and formats

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/damage-prediction.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd damage-prediction

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```python
from damage_prediction import Model

# Initialize the model
model = Model()

# Load data
model.load_data("path/to/your/data.csv")

# Train the model
model.train()

# Make predictions
predictions = model.predict(new_data)
```

### Configuration

The system can be configured by modifying the `config.yaml` file:

```yaml
model:
  type: "random_forest"  # Options: random_forest, gradient_boosting, neural_network
  parameters:
    n_estimators: 100
    max_depth: 10

data:
  features:
    - age
    - material
    - environmental_exposure
    - maintenance_history
  target: damage_severity
```

## Data Requirements

The system expects data with the following minimum structure:

- **Features**: Information about the asset (age, material, etc.)
- **Environmental Factors**: External conditions (temperature, humidity, etc.)
- **Maintenance History**: Previous repairs, inspections, etc.
- **Target Variable**: Historical damage occurrences or severity

## API Reference

### Model Class

```python
Model(config_path='config.yaml')
```

Primary class for damage prediction operations.

#### Methods

- `load_data(path)`: Load training data from file
- `train()`: Train the model on loaded data
- `evaluate()`: Evaluate model performance
- `predict(data)`: Generate damage predictions
- `export_model(path)`: Save the trained model

## Examples

### Predicting Equipment Failure

```python
from damage_prediction import Model
import pandas as pd

# Load equipment data
equipment_data = pd.read_csv("equipment_history.csv")

# Initialize and train model
model = Model(config_path="equipment_config.yaml")
model.load_data(equipment_data)
model.train()

# Predict future damage likelihood
new_equipment = pd.read_csv("current_equipment_status.csv")
predictions = model.predict(new_equipment)

# View high-risk items
high_risk = predictions[predictions['damage_probability'] > 0.7]
print(high_risk)
```
